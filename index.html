<h1>MuniHac</h1>

<p>
MuniHac is a three day Haskell hackathon taking place from <strong>Friday 16th to Sunday 18th November 2018</strong>
in the beautiful city of Munich, hosted and sponsored by TNG Technology Consulting GmbH and co-organized by Well-Typed LLP.
The Hackathon is intended to follow the tradition of other Haskell Hackathons such as the ZuriHac, HacBerlin, UHac and many others.
</p>
<p>
We have capacity for ~80 Haskellers to collaborate on any Haskell-related
project they like. There will be beginner workshops and a mentor program to
help you get started. Of course you can as well start hacking Haskell right away.
Anyone is welcome to participate. <strong>Beginner or pro, we've got you covered :)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hacking on Haskell projects will be the main focus of the event, but we will also have a
couple of talks by renowned Haskellers.
The MuniHac is furthermore  a great opportunity to meet and socialize with fellow
Haskellers and have a great time together. Among other things, we are looking
forward to having BBQ, pizza and a traditional Wei&szlig;wurstfr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck.

    <h3>Ben Gamari</h3>
    <p>
        Ben uses Haskell in fields as diverse as applied machine
        learning, scientific data analysis, robotics control, and compiler
        engineering. He is an active contributor to the Glasgow Haskell
        Compiler with focus on code generation, Core optimization, and the
        runtime system, and has worked extensively towards bringing GHC to
        the ARM architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        He has experience implementing numerical methods for machine learning, with an
        eye towards leveraging Haskell’s strong type system to enforce
        correctness at compile-time. Ben has expertise developing
        high-performance distributed systems in a wide range of
        languages. Past projects include GPU-based modelling of
        high-energy particle interactions and an implementation of
        parallel machine learning algorithms for large-scale social
        network analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        He is completing a PhD in Physics at the University of
        Massachusetts and has publications spanning social network
        analysis, computational physics, and biophysics.

    <h3>Matthew Pickering</h3>
    <p>
        Matthew is a PhD student at the University of Bristol focusing on
        program generation with applications to optimisation. In the quest
        to write the perfect program he has become a regular contributor
        to GHC where he has recently been working on making the compiler
        easier to extend by using source plugins.
